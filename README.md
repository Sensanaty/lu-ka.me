# lu-ka.me

This is the repository housing the personal portfolio website of [Luka SaleviÄ‡](https://github.com/Sensanaty), also known (online) as Sensanaty. It's built on top of Vite + Vue3, with a [Strapi](https://github.com/Sensanaty/luka-strapi) application feeding the "blog" portion of the site. The Strapi portion is hosted on AWS, while the frontend is hosted with Netlify.

## Contribution & Development

Run `yarn install` to install project dependencies. Once installed, run `yarn serve` to run a Vite server on port `3000`.

Any pushes to the master branch will be picked up by Netlify and automatically be pushed to a production level on [lu-ka.me](https://lu-ka.me).
